    <h2>BillBoard Analysis C++</h2>
    <p>Developed a comprehensive C++ program that allows users to analyze and summarize data from the Billboard charts. 
    The program utilizes a dataset featuring the top 50 songs from "The Hot 100" charts from 1960 to 2020, which is organized into three separate files by time period.
     With numerous options to choose from, the program enables users to explore the data in a variety of ways, such as displaying the Billboard information for the song(s) with the most #1 occurrences during a specific time period or showing the song with the greatest weekly climb on the charts for a given decade or year.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-item">
    <h2>Animated Bar Chart C++</h2>
    <p> Developed an interactive bar chart that uses object-oriented programming and dynamically allocated memory to display a visually appealing animation on a Linux terminal.
         The chart processes text files to generate the animation, and also includes a customizable feature that allows the user to control the playback speed by adjusting the frames per second. 
         This innovative solution combines effective data visualization with a dynamic user experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-item">
    <h2>Search Engine C++</h2>
    <p>Created a cutting-edge search engine that enables users to easily find the information they need by constructing searches based on relevant keywords. 
        To optimize performance and speed, I implemented an inverted index structure in the design. Additionally, the search engine includes a customizable feature that allows users to fine-tune their results by including or excluding specific keywords. 
        With these advanced features, the search engine is able to deliver accurate and efficient results to users in a timely manner.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-item">
    <h2>Guess Wordle Word C</h2>
    <p> Created a Wordle program in C that allows the user to either choose a secret word for the computer to guess, or have the program randomly select one. 
        The program uses various strategies, such as uppercasing a letter in the guess word if it is found in the secret word in the correct position, to try and determine the secret word. 
        Additionally, the program marks letters with an asterisk if they are found in the secret word but not in the correct position, providing the computer/program with valuable feedback and clues.
        This engaging and challenging program is a fun way to test your problem-solving skills. </p>

                <h2>Future Software Developer</h2>
                <p> As a third year computer science student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I have always been fascinated by the rapid pace of technological advancement. From a young age, I have been drawn to the latest and greatest gadgets, and I have always dreamed of being a part of the teams that create and innovate them.
                    To pursue my passion for technology, I have dedicated myself to learning a variety of programming languages, including C++/C, HTML, CSS, and Java. 
                    I have completed several projects that showcase my ability to use algorithms and constructs like sequence, decision, and repetition to solve complex problems.
                    As I look to the future, I am eager to gain professional experience through internships that will allow me to learn more about what is happening in the field and to contribute my skills and knowledge to real-world projects. 
                    I am confident that my passion and dedication to computer science will enable me to excel in any role and make a meaningful impact on the industry.
